## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click on the cells of the game board to make your move.
3. The game will indicate the current player's turn.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
5. If the game board is full and no player has won, it's a tie!

## Game Logic

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, and the structure follows a modular approach with the use of different components such as `createGameboard`, `Cell`, and `GameController`. The `displayController` handles the interaction between the game logic and the HTML elements, updating the UI based on the game state.
